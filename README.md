Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

Over the few years of programming I've done, I've solved almost all AOC problems going back to 2019. Unfortunately, I haven't maintained my solutions and will be re-solving and stashing them here for no particular reason. I hope to, eventually, solve them in all the languages I know, and will learn, for fun.
